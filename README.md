## 2. Project Description
Math Duel is a simple blockchain-based game built on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity smart contract language. It allows two players to engage in a 1v1 math quiz competition where each submits their score for the challenge. The contract stores duel pairings and scores on-chain.

- Implement leaderboard system
- NFT badges for top performers
- Frontend UI with React + Clarity SDK
